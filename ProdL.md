*ProdL* is a personal documentation project for collecting memos and hints
that may help one boost their productivity in Deep Learning study.
Since the author is more or less an old-school UNIX/Linux proponent,
you may sense a strong odor of UNIX in this document.

## 0. Prerequisites

In this section, I shall point out some keywords for background knowledge
that would greatly help you throughout the journey on deep learning.

### 0.1. Critical Instinct

Things may get much easier with the following instincts.

* Be aware of what you are doing, and what you intend to do.

* Carefully read and try to understand the output of programs.

* [Ask questions in a smart way.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

### 0.2. Programming Languages

For deep learning, I personally think some background knowledge on ANSI C,
C++ will be beneficial (in various aspects). Of course, one has to be proficient
in Python as well.

* ANSI C. It provides fundamental knowledge for programming in many other languages.
Reference book: [K&R C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)

* C++. The core parts of PyTorch, Tensorflow, as well as many other dependency
libraries such as OpenCV are written in C++. It is suitable for some
performance-critical tasks.

* Python. An interpreted "glue" language. The standard Python interpreter is
called `cpython`, which suffers from poor performance (compared to compiled
languages), and GIL for multi-thread programming.

I recommend the [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
as the core reference if you are new to Python. Note, please stay away from
the ancient Python2 in case you intend to learn Python from other resources.

Compiled languages v.s. interpreted languages: TODO

### 0.3. Domain Specific Languages

* Markdown.

* RestructuredText.

* Makefile.

### 0.4. Computer Organization

### 0.5. Operating System and POSIX

### 0.6. Fundamental Tools

Including coreutils, findutils, etc.

### 0.7. Remote Access

### 0.8. Software Engineering

### 0.9. Git Workflow

Extremely important for production sanity, safety, and reliability.
