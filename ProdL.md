*ProdL* is a personal documentation project for collecting memos and hints
that may help one boost their productivity in Deep Learning study.
Since the author is more or less an old-school UNIX/Linux proponent,
you may sense a strong odor of UNIX in this document.

## 0. Prerequisites

In this section, I shall point out some keywords for background knowledge
that would greatly help you throughout the journey on deep learning.

### 0.1. Critical Instinct

Things may get much easier with the following instincts.

* Be aware of what you are doing, and what you intend to do.

* Carefully read and try to understand the output of programs.

* [Ask questions in a smart way.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

### 0.2. Programming Languages

For deep learning, I personally think some background knowledge on ANSI C,
C++ will be beneficial (in various aspects). Of course, one has to be proficient
in Python as well.

* ANSI C. It provides fundamental knowledge for programming in many other languages.
Reference book: [K&R C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)

* C++. The core parts of PyTorch, Tensorflow, as well as many other dependency
libraries such as OpenCV are written in C++. It is suitable for some
performance-critical tasks.

* Python. An interpreted "glue" language. The standard Python interpreter is
called `cpython`, which suffers from poor performance (compared to compiled
languages), and GIL for multi-thread programming.

I recommend the [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
as the core reference if you are new to Python. Note, please stay away from
the ancient Python2 in case you intend to learn Python from other resources.
